About This Playbook


This playbook represents a first step toward defining the governing
principles and best practices which will enable developers to build
great conversational applications. It is the result of several years
of practical experience building and deploying dozens of the most
advanced conversational applications achievable. Cutting-edge research
and state-of-the-art algorithms are not surveyed here; there are many
other resources available for that purpose. Instead, this playbook
focuses on helping developers and data scientists build real
production applications. The detailed instructions, practical advice,
and real-world examples provided here should empower developers to
improve the quality and variety of conversational experiences of the
coming months and years.

The Introduction provides an overview of the state of the art in
building conversational applications and discusses tradeoffs
associated with different implementation approaches.

The Step-by-Step Guide illustrates how to build an end-to-end
conversational application using MindMeld, the Conversational AI
toolkit. You can apply it directly while building a conversational
application, or just read it to learn the essentials of MindMeld.

The Blueprint Applications section explains how to use MindMeld to
quickly build and test a fully working conversational application
without writing code or collecting training data. You can bootstrap a
Blueprint app into a more specialized and powerful conversational
application, or just use the Blueprint app as a demo or research tool.

The User Guide covers each component of the MindMeld platform in depth
and explains how to use MindMeld to build and configure each component
for optimal performance. It functions as a technical supplement that
details how to improve an application built following either the Step-
by-Step Guide or the Blueprint Applications. The User Guide highlights
many common techniques and best practices that contribute to
successful conversational experiences today.

The Versions section contains a Recent Changes section which you
should always consult before installing or upgrading MindMeld.

Readers should be familiar with Machine Learning and the Python
programming language, including functional knowledge of the scikit-
learn python package.

For those who wish to use the deep learning models included in
MindMeld, familiarity with the TensorFlow library is recommended.


How to Use these Docs


The questions and answers below explain how to use this Conversational
AI Playbook to support your individual needs as a developer and
learner.



Q: What is Conversational AI? Why does MindMeld exist and what
does it do?

A: Read the Introduction. This explains what MindMeld does
differently from other platforms and toolkits.



Q: What is the methodology for building Conversational AI
applications with MindMeld?

A: Read the Step-by-Step Guide. This and the User Guide together
form the main body of knowledge for MindMeld developers.



Q: How do I quickly get a pre-built MindMeld app running, either
as a learning exercise or as a baseline for my own application?

A: Follow the instructions in Blueprint Applications.



Q: How do I apply the Step-by-Step methodology to my own MindMeld
app, either building from scratch or extending a Blueprint app?

A: Work through either the Step-by-Step Guide or the section of
Blueprint Applications that’s appropriate for your use case. Where
those docs refer you to the User Guide, apply the in-depth material in
the User Guide to improve your application’s performance or increase
its sophistication, as needed.

The User Guide and the Step-by-Step Guide together form the main body
of knowledge for MindMeld developers.
