Anatomy of a Conversational AI Interaction
==========================================

Hundreds of millions of people around the world use conversational assistants every single day. They invoke these assistants on their smartphone, on their laptop, in their car, using a connected device, or within many different applications. Some of these conversational assistants are voice-enabled and can listen to and respond in spoken language. Others are text-based and can read and respond to typed messages and requests. No matter the medium, application or device, all conversational interfaces rely on a set of core underlying technologies in order to understand natural language input and engage in a human-like conversational interaction. The diagram below illustrates the key technology steps which underlie modern conversational applications.

Depending on your application, some or all of these steps may be required. For example, if you are building a chat assistant for a messaging platform such as Facebook Messenger, the input and output are text rather than voice. In this case, steps 1, 2 and 12 are not required. If you are building an application which only performs simple actions and does not require answering questions, then step 9, question answering, may not be necessary. If your intention is to build a voice assistant that demonstrates the same level of accuracy and versatility as products like Siri, Alexa and Cortana, then all of the 12 components identified above are likely required.
