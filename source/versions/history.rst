Package History
===============

4.3.2 (2020-10-15)
------------------

Major Features and Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add auto entity annotating tool which leverages pre-trained NLP models to add entity annotations to training queries

- Add model tracking through DVC integration

- Add progress bars for classifier training

- Add sentiment features for classifiers

- Add support for custom resolution in custom evaluation function for Automatic Slotfilling

- Allow detailed entity resolution from Duckling

- Allow the MindMeld tokenizer to preserve special characters

- Allow the MindMeld app to configure the max history length that they should keep

- Allow the role classifier to process a single label

- Expose Elasticsearch scoring in QA responses


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed issue were entities were not immutable in the request object

- Fixed issue were the system entity recognizer would be loaded without being initialized

- Fixed token mismatch issue in the system entity feature extractor for queries with special characters. Retraining entity recognition models that use sys-candidates-seq feature is recommended.


Legacy
^^^^^^

- Add log warnings for Python 3.5; we will officially remove support in the next release


4.3.1 (2020-06-17)
------------------

Major Features and Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Custom Actions provide the ability for applications to integrate external dialogue management logic with MindMeld applications

- Question Answerer can now leverage deep-learning based semantic embeddings (BERT, Glove) to produce more relevant answers to queries (available for Elasticsearch 7 and above)

- Automatic slot filing allows an intuitive way for developers to automatically prompt users for missing slots to fulfill an intent

- A new banking blueprint for enterprise use-cases

- WhatsApp Bot Integration with MindMeld

- Docker setup update to Elasticsearch 7

- MindMeld application can configure language and locale settings in the application config file


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Addressed an issue which caused MindMeld to not detect system entities with no surrounding context (for example: "december 21st")

- Previously, MindMeld applications called Elasticsearch even if the application did not functionally use it (i.e have no entity to resolve); This has been fixed in :doc:`Managing Dependencies <../userguide/optional_dependency>`

- MindMeld had a dependency on Pandas which increased the overall library footprint and is removed in MindMeld 4.3


4.2.0 (2019-09-16)

Bug Fixes and Other Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Implement the ``predict_proba()`` method for role classifiers and entity classifiers

- Add support for query stemming during feature extraction

- Add support for numerical parser features for domain and intent classification

- Add support for asynchronous dialogue state handlers

- Refactor classifier features names to make them more consistent

- Re-enable automatic blueprint loading using the ``blueprint`` command

- Deprecate the ``session`` object and replace it with the ``context`` object

- Add support for parallel processing of entity recognition for n-best ASR transcripts

- MindMeld version compatibility checks are warnings, not exceptions

^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add the ability to add dialogue middleware to dialogue managers

- Add the ability to denote a handler as only reachable via target_dialogue_state

- Add the ability to explicitly denote a default handler

- Add the ability to specify different custom datasets for different NLP models

3.3.0 (2018-05-10)
------------------

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add the ability to specify the time zone and timestamp associated with each query to inform NLP predictions

- Add the ability to define custom preprocessors that can make arbitrary transformations on the input query before sending it to the NLP pipeline

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- The help messages for MindMeld command line tools (``python app.py`` and ``mmworkbench``) should show the correct list of compatible commands

- Various fixes to improve the numerical parser's robustness and logging


3.2.0 (2017-10-23)
------------------

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network as a model option for the entity recognizer

- Add support for TensorFlow-based deep learning models in MindMeld

- Add the ability to evaluate all NLP models at once with a single method/command

- Add functionality to specify a target dialogue state or a set of allowable intents for the next turn

- Add in-built support for conversational history management instead of relying on the client to preserve history across turns

- Improve interfaces for constructing responses within the dialogue state handlers (see **Compatibility Notes** below)


Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The ``prompt()`` and ``respond()`` methods of the ``DialogueResponder`` object are deprecated in MindMeld 3.2. See :doc:`Working with the Dialogue Manager <../userguide/dm>` to learn how to use new ``DialogueResponder`` methods in your dialogue state handlers.

3.1.0 (2017-09-20)
------------------

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) as a model option for the entity recognizer

- Allow the role classifier to be trained with other text models (e.g. SVM, decision tree, etc.) in addition to logistic regression

- Make model configuration format for all classifiers consistent [See "Compatibility Notes" below]

- Add new metrics for better error analysis of entity recognition performance

- Add support for modularizing dialogue state handling logic by allowing arbitrary module imports in ``app.py`` (see **Compatibility Notes** below)

- Make blueprints check the current MindMeld package version to validate compatibility

- Only load NLP resources that are needed by active feature extractors (as defined in the model config) to improve runtime performance

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Correctly compute entity spans in queries with special characters

- Warn the developer and proceed with model training (if possible) when entity mapping or gazetteer files are missing

Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- To make the interfaces for NLP classifiers consistent, the model configuration formats for the entity recognizer and the role classifier have been updated to be in line with the domain and intent classifiers. The model configurations for entity recognizer and role classifier from MindMeld 3.0 **will not** work with MindMeld 3.1. Refer to the user guide for those components to learn how to rewrite your 3.0 configs in the new 3.1 format.

- To support modular organization of dialogue state handling logic by allowing arbitrary package/module imports in the application container (``app.py``), MindMeld now needs to load the project folder as a Python package. Every project in MindMeld 3.1 must hence have an empty ``__init__.py`` file at its root level. Projects created for MindMeld 3.0 **will not** work with MindMeld 3.1 unless an ``__init__.py`` file is added. Refer to the user guide for the dialogue manager to learn how to use imports in your application container.
