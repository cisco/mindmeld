Building a Conversational Interface in 10 Steps
===============================================

Great conversational applications require both advanced technology and solid design judgement. The most widely used conversational applications today, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana, are all built using a similar set of techniques and technologies to ensure both high accuracy and utility. This Step-by-Step Guide outlines the methodology used to build today's most advanced and useful conversational applications.

Taking a conversational application from conception to production typically entails completing the ten implementation steps summarized below.

== ===
1  Select the right use case
2  Script your ideal dialogue interactions
3  Define the domain, intent, entity, and role hierarchy
4  Define the dialogue state handlers
5  Create the question answerer knowledge base
6  Generate representative training data
7  Train the natural language processing classifiers
8  Implement the language parser
9  Optimize question answering performance
10 Deploy trained models to production
